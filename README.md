# Neural Networks Project: Image Classification with CIFAR-10

## Overview
In this project, I have built a robust CNN to categorize images into one of the ten available classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model recognizes patterns and features in images to accurately classify them.<br>

Key Features: <br>
**Deep Learning**: Using CNNs for hierarchical model learning.<br>
**Data Augmentation**: Enhanced the dataset through modern augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.<br>
**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied rigorous hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best model performance.<br>
**Performance Visualization**: Integrated tools for visualizing the model's performance metrics dynamically.<br>
