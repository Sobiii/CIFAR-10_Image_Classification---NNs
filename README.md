# Neural Networks: Image Classification with CIFAR-10

## Overview
I have constructed a robust CNN to classify images into one of the ten available classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset. By employing deep learning techniques, the model identifies patterns and features in images to achieve accurate classification.<br>

### Key Features: <br>
**Deep Learning**: Utilising CNNs for hierarchical model learning.<br>
**Data Augmentation**: Enhancing the dataset using modern augmentation techniques to improve model generalisation.<br>
**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applying rigorous hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal model performance.<br>
**Performance Visualisation**: Integrating tools to dynamically visualise the model's performance metrics.<br>
